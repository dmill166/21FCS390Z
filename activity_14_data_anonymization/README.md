# Activity 14

## Data Anonymization

## Goal
In this activity you are given a dataset of 1K employees. Because the collection contains personally identifiable information, your task is to apply data anonymization techniques as a pre-process procedure. 

## Instructions

Create a Jupyter notebook with the following sections: 

### Preamble

Title: *HR Data Anonymization*

Author: *\<your name\>*

Email: *\<your email\>*

Last Update: *\<date\>*

### Dataset

Create metadata information describing the attributes of your dataset. 

### Data Anonymization

Identify the attributes that contain personal information. Devise a method to anonymize each of the attributes identified in this section.  

Once you have completed the data anonymization, save the new dataset in a csv file.
