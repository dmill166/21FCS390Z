The Gini coefficient was developed by the statistician and sociologist Corrado Gini.\n",

    "    * A Gini coefficient of one (or 100%) expresses maximal inequality among values (e.g., for a large number of people where only one person has all the income or consumption and all others have none, the Gini coefficient will be nearly one).\"\n",
