## Community Detection (Karate Club Dataset)

The goal of this activity is to perform a data analysis aiming to detect communities in a dataset using the Louvain algorithm. 

## Instructions 

* create a Neo4J db locally and install the Graph Data Science (GDS) plugin. 
* finish to-do (part 1) in src/karate.py to create the nodes and the relationship
* use src/karate.cypher to run the Louvain algorithm on Neo4J desktop and download communities info
* finish to-do (part 2) in src/karate.py to add a community label to each node 
* using Neo4J desktop, display each community with a different color
