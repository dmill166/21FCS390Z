# Homework 06

## Decision Tree

## Goal
Split the diabetes dataset into training (10%) and test (90%).  Then create a decision tree model and compute its accuracy. Does the accuracy of your model changes when you increase the size of your training set? Can you plot a learning curve?

## Instructions

Create a Jupyter notebook with the following sections:
